## WiDS : Into the RLverse
This project is a part of "Winter in Data Science(WiDS), 2023" conducted by Analytics Club, IIT Bombay. The mentors for this project are Atharva Bendale and Vishal Bysani.

## Project Schedule
- Week 1 : Recap of Python programming and introduction to Python libraries such as NumPy, MatPlotlib, PyTorch. Introduction to Reinforcement Learning and multi-armed bandits. Simulating a multi-armed bandits problem to be solved in next week.
- Week 2 : Introduction to Markov Decision Processes and implementing basic algorithm to train an RL agent which can find optimal policies for an MDP. Learning about discounting and also exploitation-exploration tradeoff.
- Week 3 : Learning about different types of control algorithms (MC, TD, etc) and using them to solve TicTacToe and environments from OpenAI Gymnasium API.
- Week 4 : Introduction to Deep Q Networks, and using it to solve continuous space problems (CartPole, MountainCar).
- Week 5 : The Final project is to make a RL agent using Dueling Deep Q Networks which plays any complex game from Gymnasium of the mentees' choice (like Pong, Tetris, Bowling & Breakout).

## Resources
We will mostly follow "Reinforcement Learning : An introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto" and "Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning" throughout this course for reinforcment learning concepts.
