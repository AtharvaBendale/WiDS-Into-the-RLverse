## Week 3 - Into the RLverse


Welcome to Week 3, in this week we will learn about RL algorithms for prediction and control such as Monte Carlo (first visit, every visit and exploring starts), Temporal Difference ( TD(0), TD(n), TD(λ) ), SARSA, Q-learning, Double Q-learning etc.
- This week's reading is chapter 5 "Evaluating agent's behavior" from Pg 155 - Pg 187 and chapter 6 "Improving agent's behavior" from Pg 183 - Pg 196 of [Grokking RL](../GrokkingRL.pdf), the content of this week is not hard but will take some time so please start soon.
- The assignment for this week is in [TicTacToe.ipynb](./TicTacToe.ipynb) where you have to build an agent capable of playing TicTacToe, please complete it before moving further.
- (Optional) You have to get acquainted with [basic usage of OpenAI Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/content/basic_usage/) which provides simple interface for all single agent reinforcement learning environments, and includes implementations of many common environments. Try playing with different functions and environments, we will use this in later week for environments.
