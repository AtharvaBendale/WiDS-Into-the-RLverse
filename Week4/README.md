## Week4 - Introduction to deep Reinforcement Learning
Welcome to Week4 on this project, this week you will see some pretty satisying results with the powerful Deep Q Networks. You have to "solve" the cartpole environment from the OpenAI Gymnasium API using Deep Q networks.
<br>
<br>
This week you have to:
- Read Pg 248 - Pg 246 and from Pg 276 - Pg 284 (both with respect to the book) of [GrokkingRL](../GrokkingRL.pdf), this will briefly introducte you to deep reinforcement learning starting with function approximation, you will learn about Neural Fitted Q Iteration (NFQI), and DQN (more important network which builds on NFQI while addressing some of it's main drawbacks).
- You have to get acquainted with [basic usage of OpenAI Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/content/basic_usage/) which provides simple interface for all single agent reinforcement learning environments, and includes implementations of many common environments. Try playing with different functions and environments, we will use this in later week for environments.
- This week will introduce you to many new concepts but you will be comfortable with them as they are not much difficult, the coding component of this week is more in quantity but much straightforward, I have tried to make it as much guided as possible suggesting ideal practices at many places in the assignment, still this is bound to have some confusion so please ask for clarifications, and don't start the week's reading and assignment 2 days before the deadline, you are bound to have problems if you do this.
- Head on to [Assignment](./Assignment/) folder for this week's assignment and best of luck for your first deep RL assignment, hope you are excited :)
